PyTeal is the Python language binding for Algorand's Smart Contract Language, TEAL. While Solidity is more expressive and high-level compared to TEAL, I'll try to translate the given Solidity contract's logic into PyTeal to the best of my ability.

Here's a PyTeal example inspired by your Solidity contract:



Please note that this PyTeal version is quite simplified:

We are only focusing on the application's creation and rent and maintenance payment functionalities.
It lacks the logic for transferring ownership, buying the building, withdrawing funds, and managing penalties.
TEAL/PyTeal is a more low-level language compared to Solidity, so certain things like events are not directly translatable.
This script doesn't use PyTeal's newer high-level features available in version 0.7+.
To fully recreate the logic of the Solidity contract in PyTeal, additional code would be needed. Remember to thoroughly test any smart contract before deployment or production use.
