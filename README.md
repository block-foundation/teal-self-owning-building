## Introduction

Blockchain Autonomous Building Management!

Welcome to our revolutionary project - an autonomous building management system built on the Blockchain. The project integrates a unique blend of real estate management and blockchain technology, creating an ecosystem where a building can effectively "own" itself. This concept is a stepping stone to decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and a significant leap forward for blockchain applications in real estate.

Our autonomous building management system employs smart contracts to manage and oversee a building's fundamental operational aspects, including rent collection, maintenance costs, and ownership transfers. The smart contracts, which are blockchain's primary building blocks, are immutable, transparent, and verifiable pieces of code that automatically execute transactions when predefined conditions are met.

In the context of our project, these smart contracts come to life as entities managing a building. They collect rent from tenants, pay maintenance costs, and can even transfer ownership when the building is bought. We implement penalty mechanisms for late payments, ensuring all stakeholders are held accountable.

This system can have profound implications for reducing administrative overhead, increasing efficiency, and fostering a new level of transparency in the real estate sector.

Please note, this project showcases the potential of blockchain technology. As with any significant technology implementation, thorough testing is required before actual use. Blockchain and smart contract technology is complex, and mistakes can lead to severe consequences, including loss of funds. Always consult with experts when interacting with such systems.

Join us as we explore this unique amalgamation of blockchain and real estate, transforming the way we manage and interact with buildings in the future. Welcome to the future of autonomous building management!

## Quick Start



## Contract

Please note that this PyTeal version is quite simplified:

- We are only focusing on the application's creation and rent and maintenance payment functionalities.
- It lacks the logic for transferring ownership, buying the building, withdrawing funds, and managing penalties.
- TEAL/PyTeal is a more low-level language compared to Solidity, so certain things like events are not directly translatable.
- This script doesn't use PyTeal's newer high-level features available in version 0.7+.
- To fully recreate the logic of the Solidity contract in PyTeal, additional code would be needed. Remember to thoroughly test any smart contract before deployment or production use.
